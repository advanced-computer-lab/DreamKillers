# **DreamKillers Airline System**
  In this project, we create a flight reservation system to facilitate flights booking and management. With 3 different user types, the system 
  encompasses different functionalities depending on the needs of each user. First, an Admin to manage the the entries in the system. Second, a Guest User 
  to browse through the system. Last, an Existing User to take action and reserve seats on the selected flights.
# **Motivation**
  The main intention behind this project is to hasten the flight reservation process. Instead of spending and effort time going to reservation office or face the trouble
  and confusion of navigating othe booking systems, we created this system with simplicity in mind. Rather than having the naunce of navigating through tedious menus to find
  the flight option best for you, our system allows you to do it with a simple search.
# **Build Status**
  This is a development build and the system is not yet deployed. This system might sometimes take a few extra seconds to process your request and it is perfectly normal

# **Code Style**
The main library used in the FrontEnd is react. Each component is in a folder that has its name along with a module.css flie 
standard node.js was used for the BackEnd with routers, modules, and main app all separated in appropriate folders. Throughout the project, camelCase was used to name all variables
and CamelCase was used to name components. The code was formatted with prettier and is displayed in its standard layout.
