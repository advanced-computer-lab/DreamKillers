# **DreamKillers Airline System**
  In this project, we create a flight reservation system to facilitate flights booking and management. With 3 different user types, the system 
  encompasses different functionalities depending on the needs of each user. First, an Admin to manage the the entries in the system. Second, a Guest User 
  to browse through the system. Last, an Existing User to take action and reserve seats on the selected flights.
# **Motivation**
  The main intention behind this project is to hasten the flight reservation process. Instead of spending and effort time going to reservation office or face the trouble
  and confusion of navigating othe booking systems, we created this system with simplicity in mind. Rather than having the naunce of navigating through tedious menus to find
  the flight option best for you, our system allows you to do it with a simple search.
# **Build Status**
  This is a development build and the system is not yet deployed. This system might sometimes take a few extra seconds to process your request and it is perfectly normal

# **Code Style**

We used The MERN Stack to build our project. The main library used in the FrontEnd is react. Each component is in a folder that has its name along with a module.css flie 
standard node.js was used for the BackEnd with routers, modules, and main app all separated in appropriate folders. Throughout the project, camelCase was used to name all variables
and CamelCase was used to name components. The code was formatted with prettier and is displayed in its standard layout.

# **Features**

This is where you write what all extra features have been done in your project. Basically this is where you try to make your project stand out from the rest.

# **Code Examples**

This is where you try to compress your project and make the reader understand what it does as simply as possible. This should help the reader understand if your code solves their issue.

# **Installation**

1-npm : By writing npm install in the IDE integrated terminal.  
2-Development environment : ex VS code .
3-Libraries can be installed using npm install .

# **API reference**

If your project is small, then we can add the reference docs in the readme. For larger projects, it is better to provide links to where the API reference documentation is documented.

# **Tests**

This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples

# **How to Use?**

As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is better to explain steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it.

# **Contribute**

This is where you let them know that they can contribute and help you out. A guideline on how to contribute is also helpful
